# iris-classification
The Iris Classification project involves creating a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. This is a classic problem in machine learning and is often used as an introductory example for classification algorithms
